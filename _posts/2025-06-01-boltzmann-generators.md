This post goes over the basic of Boltzmann distribution and generative models learning them.

## Background

First, we briefly go over the backgroudn knolwedge about molecular systems and the Boltzmann distribution.

### Molecular systems

Consider a molecular systems constiting of $N$ atoms.

### Boltzmann distribution

Boltzmann distribution is a proportional distribution against energy.

### Boltzmann generators

Finally, the Boltzmann generators (BGs)

## Generative models

Generative models have shown success in many areas.

### Transferable Boltzmann generators

The transferable Boltzmann generators

### Sequential Boltzmann generators

The sequential boltzmann generators
